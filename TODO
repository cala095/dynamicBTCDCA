MUST HAVE
-------------------------------------------------------------
[] TODO VOLUME
i have to update the method i'm using to sum volumes for the minute in trading view.
instead of summing directly i have to subtract the last value known for the minute to the new one (wich will be bigger) and the update

[] HANDLE DATA BACK-UP FOR LIVE PROCESSED AND AVOID DATA REPLICATION IN LIVE

OPTIONAL
-------------------------------------------------------------
[] TODO OPTIONS VOLUME
i should add the options volume to easely track sentiment (maybe when we go commercial it will cost a lot)

[] OPTIMIZE processer.py
i'm reading the whole file i can just check the last line and append the live data since they should both be clean at this point

[] IMPROVE TERMINAL UPDATES FOR processer.py WHEN MANAGED AND LAUNCHED BY dataFetcher.py  
terminal don't show update for it untill completition but it works and logs correctly

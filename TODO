MUST HAVE
-------------------------------------------------------------
[] TODO VOLUME
i have to update the method i'm using to sum volumes for the minute in trading view.
instead of summing directly i have to subtract the last value known for the minute to the new one (wich will be bigger) and the update


OPTIONAL
-------------------------------------------------------------
[] TODO OPTIONS VOLUME
i should add the options volume to easely track sentiment (maybe when we go commercial it will cost a lot)

[] OPTIMIZE processer.py
i'm reading the whole file i can just check the last line and append the live data since they should both be clean at this point
